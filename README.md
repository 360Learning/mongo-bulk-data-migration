# MongoDB bulk data migration for NodeJs

_Mongodb schema migration utility_

## About

`MongoBulkDataMigration` is a 1-liner MongoDb migration utility for your 1-shot schema migrations.
It is fast and resume-able, handles rollback automatically.

### Why MongoBulkDataMigration?

- üöÄ **fast**: built over [Mongo Bulk operations](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/Bulk/) to less stress the Mongo socket. Bulk is adapted to massive update as it groups write operations.

- üèîÔ∏è **scalable**: working on 1 million / 1 billion documents is not an issue.
  Backup is done in a dedicated collection. Bulks can be throttled.

- üîí **safe and easy**: Backup and restore is done progressively by bulk.
  Whatever is fetched and projected is what is saved as backup. Script built over MBDM is explicit and focused.

- üîÑ **resume-able**: a script can be resumed if it crashes _(disconnection)_.
  By design, it's safe to run it twice in update or rollback mode.

- üíù **minimal**: A "unified" extension script is handle by the platform to write less code.
  Also, the test util `doRollbackAndAssertForInitialState` will simplify test writing for Jest and Chai frameworks.

- üèîÔ∏è **Aggregate-ready**: You can fetch using a simple query or an aggregation pipeline


### üö´ Prerequisite to use DM

MBDM fits most needs, but not all needs.
Prerequisite:

- DM can't insert new documents
  _(you can only update or delete documents)_
- DM query has to not match an updated document _(this would break the resume-ability - use an aggregate pipeline for more complex queries)_
- DM can only update **1 collection at a time**
- DM can only update a document **once** for a same migration ID _(unless you clean backup manually in-between)_

### ‚úÖ DM capabilities

Biggest features making DM powerful:

- DM can **automatically rollback** to the exact same state projected values:
  - for `$set` operations
  - for `$unset` operations
  - for document deletion operations
  - ... for anything more advanced, you can still rollback using a custom `rollback` function
- DM accepts basic Mongo queries, or **aggregation pipelines**,
- DM can compute a document update operation in an **async callback**, with a defined `maxConcurrentUpdateCalls`, allowing you to call a complex asynchronous code.
- DM makes chore script writing fast üöÄ

## Usage & doc

### `update()` and `rollback()`
Main interface to use in your migration script CLI.

```ts
import { MongoBulkDataMigration } from "@360-l/mongo-bulk-data-migration";

const migration = new MongoBulkDataMigration(...);

// Do the update
await migration.update();

// Revert updated properties (only) in all updated documents
await migration.rollback();
```

### Simple $set example

This migration will set `{ total: 0 }` for every doc not having 0.

_Note: rollback will automatically unset back total._

```ts
new MongoBulkDataMigration<Score>({
    db,
    id: "scores_set_total",
    collectionName: "scores",
    projection: {},
    query: { total: { $exists: false } },
    update: { $set: { total: 0 } }
});
```

### Simple $set with update callback and projection

This migration will sum 2 projected fields `scoreA` and `scoreB` for all documents (no filter).

_Note: rollback will automatically set back `scoreA` and `scoreB` and reset `total`._

```ts
new MongoBulkDataMigration<Score>({
    db,
    id: "scores_total_new_field",
    collectionName: "scores",
    projection: { scoreA: 1, scoreB: 1 },
    query: {},
    update: (doc) => { $set: { total: doc.scoreA + doc.scoreB } }
});
```

### Delete documents

This migration will delete doc having negative `total`.

_Note: rollback will automatically restore full document._

```ts
import { MongoBulkDataMigration, DELETE_OPERATION } from "@360-l/mongo-bulk-data-migration";
...
new MongoBulkDataMigration<Score>({
    db,
    id: "delete_negative_total",
    collectionName: "scores",
    projection: {}, // Everything needs to be projected
    query: { total: { $lt: 0 } },
    update: DELETE_OPERATION,
});
```
